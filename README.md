# Simple-Primitives

Hellow! This repo holds the code base which I worked on during my internship at Q. The folder Ginger-soft.github.io holds the code that I host on my private [github page](https://ginger-soft.github.io/) which is my private githubpage. The folder Simple-Primitives holds the project files I used to develop this prototype. Information about the code structure and other project documentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VFjOFDmIV8fPqBA5jz5TSQLcmWkzKp9q), note that the documentation is in Dutch.
